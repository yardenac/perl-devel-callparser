NAME

Devel::CallParser - custom parsing attached to subroutines

DESCRIPTION

This module provides a C API, for XS modules, concerned with custom
parsing.  It is centred around the function "cv_set_call_parser", which
allows XS code to attach a magical annotation to a Perl subroutine,
resulting in resolvable calls to that subroutine having their arguments
parsed by arbitrary C code.  (This is a more conveniently structured
facility than the core's "PL_keyword_plugin" API.)  This module makes
"cv_set_call_parser" and several supporting functions available.

This module provides the implementation of the functions at runtime,
and also at compile time supplies the C header file which provides access
to the functions.
